# Suppose we have an array of length n = 9: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
# If we want to rotate left by d = 2, answer is: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]
# But what if someone says rotate left by d = 11? 
# rotate by 9 â†’ array unchanged , Rotating by 11 is the same as rotating by 11 % 9 = 2.
# so we use d % n  i.e 11 %9 =2 only 2 rotations needed.
